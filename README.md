## Face Recognition App with Real-time Python Backend 

This repository showcases a complete Flutter application for face recognition with a Python backend for real-time processing. 

**Key Features:**

* **Mobile Face Recognition:** Utilizes Flutter and the camera package to capture live video frames from the phone's camera.
* **Image Compression:** Efficiently compresses captured images before sending them for recognition, optimizing network bandwidth.
* **WebSocket Communication:** Employs WebSockets for real-time, two-way communication between the mobile app and the backend server.
* **Face Recognition Backend:** Leverages the powerful `face_recognition` library for accurate face detection and comparison.
* **Multi-Class Detection:** Identifies different scenarios: successful recognition ("Hi, Sayak!"), unrecognized face, and no face detected.
* **Modular Design:** Separates the mobile application logic from the face recognition backend, promoting code maintainability and reusability.


This project demonstrates strong skills in:

* **Flutter Development:** Building mobile applications with a focus on user experience and camera integration.
* **Real-time Processing:** Implementing efficient communication between mobile and backend for real-time face recognition.
* **Python Libraries:** Utilizing `face_recognition` for face detection and comparison tasks.
* **Software Design:** Building a modular application with clear separation of concerns.

I have designed this codebase in a  well-structured, easy to understand manner, and it provides a solid foundation for building more advanced face recognition applications.
